EarthFace
=========
EarthFace is a web application that lets you visualize any type of data geographically as a heat map! See our live [demo](http://earthface.mybluemix.net/) hosted on IBM Bluemix.

Description
-----------
Our project seeks to bring awareness to all people about their surroundings. Often times, we are oblivious to the various phenomena that are constantly occurring all around us. Tapping into the plethora of information made available from NASA Earth Observations (NEO), EarthFace can transform data for things ranging from carbon monoxide levels to land surface temperatures, into heat maps, even allowing various maps to stack as layers, to create a unique, visual insight into the presence, abundance, and interactions of all these phenomena.
