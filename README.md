EarthFace
=========

EarthFace is a web application that lets you visualize any type of data geographically as a heat map! See our live [demo](http://earthface.mybluemix.net/).

Description
-----------

Our project seeks to bring awareness to all people about their surroundings. Often times, we are oblivious to the various phenomena that are constantly occurring all around us. Tapping into the plethora of information made available from NASA Earth Observations (NEO), EarthFace can transform data for things ranging from carbon monoxide levels to land surface temperatures, into heat maps for any specified region. Using your GPS location, EarthFace will generate a visualization of all the information about your general vicinity, opening your eyes to a bigger world.
